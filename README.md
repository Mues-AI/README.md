Mues AI is an Agentic-AI layer that helps increase product adoption for modern SaaS products.

## 🚀 What is Mues AI?

[Mues AI](https://mues.ai/) enables your SaaS users to interact with your product just like they would with a power user.

Instead of searching through documentation or opening support tickets, they simply **ask** — and Mues AI handles it.

From onboarding to advanced workflows, Mues turns your app into a self-sufficient product experience.

## Why We Built It

We saw the same pattern across many SaaS products:

- Users sign up, try to achieve a task
- They get stuck, open support tickets, or churn
- Documentation goes unread, leaving value undiscovered

We wanted to build a product adoption system that exists **inside the product**, not as an add-on—so users can simply *ask* and the AI acts.


## 👩‍💻 Example Use

**User flow**:

1. User clicks **"Ask AI"** inside the app
2. Types: *“Create a new top-level category named ‘Finance’”*
3. Mues moves the cursor, completes the workflow as requested
4. No documentation read, no waiting—just action

## 🎯 Who This Helps

- SaaS **Product Managers** designing complex user journeys
- **Customer Support Leaders** looking to reduce ticket volume
- Enterprise products targeting non-technical users
- Growth teams aiming for **Product-Led Growth**
